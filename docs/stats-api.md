The Plausible Stats API offers a way to retrieve your stats programmatically. It is a read-only interface to present historical
and real-time stats only. At the moment there is no API to send pageviews or custom events to our backend nor can you manage your sites through
the API.

The API accepts GET requests with query parameters and returns standard HTTP responses along with a JSON-encoded body. All API requests must be made over HTTPS.
Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

Each request must be authenticated with an API key using the Bearer Token method. You can obtain an API key for your account by going to your user
settings page [plausible.io/settings](https://plausible.io/settings).

The easiest way to explore the API is by using our Postman collection. Just define your `TOKEN` and `SITE_ID` variables and you'll have an executable API reference ready to go.

## Concepts

Querying the Plausible API will feel familiar if you have used time-series databases before. You cannot query individual records from
our stats database. You can only request aggregated metrics over a certain time period.

Each request requires a `site_id` parameter which is the domain of your site as configured in Plausible. If you're unsure, navigate to your site
settings in Plausible and grab the value of the `domain` field.

### Time periods

The options are identical for each endpoint that supports configurable time periods. Each period
is relative to a `date` parameter. The date should follow the standard ISO-8601 format. When not specified, the `date` field defaults to `today(site.timezone)`.
All time calculations on our backend are done in the timezone that the site is configured in.

* `12mo,6mo` - Last n calendar months relative to `date`
* `month` - The calendar month that `date` falls into
* `30d,7d` - Last n days relative to `date`
* `day` - Stats for the full day specified in `date`
* `custom` - Provide a custom range in the `date` parameter.

When using a custom range, the `date` parameter expects two ISO-8601 formatted dates joined with a comma as follows `?period=custom&date=2021-01-01,2021-01-31`.
Stats will be returned for the whole date range inclusive of the start and end dates.

### Properties

Each pageview and custom event in our database has some predefined _properties_ associated with it. In other analytics tools, these
are often referred to as _dimensions_ as well. Properties can be used for filtering and breaking down your stats to drill into
more depth. Here's the full list of properties we collect automatically:

| Property                   | Example                       | Description                                                                                                                           |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| event:name                 | pageview                      | Name of the event triggered. `pageview` is a reserved event name but custom events can be named anything.                             |
| event:page                 | /blog/remove-google-analytics | Pathname of the page where the event is triggered                                                                                     |
| visit:source               | Twitter                       | Visit source, populated from an url query parameter tag (`utm_source`, `source` or `ref`) or the `Referer` HTTP header.               |
| visit:referrer             | t.co/fzWTE9OTPt               | Raw `Referer` header without `http://`, `http://` or `www.`                                                                           |

| visit:utm_campaign         | profile                       | Raw value of the `utm_campaign` query param on the entry page                                                                         |
| visit:device               | Desktop                       | Device type. Possible values are `Desktop`, `Laptop`, `Tablet` and `Mobile`                                                           |

#### Custom props

In addition to props that are collected automatically, you can also query for [custom properties](/custom-event-goals#using-custom-props).
To filter or break down by a custom property, use the key `event:props:<custom_prop_name>`. [See example](#breakdown-custom-event-by-custom-props) for how to use it.

Currently clients are limited to filtering or breaking down on just one custom property at a time. Custom prop filters and breakdowns
cannot be combined arbitrarily. We are aware of this issue and we have plans to fix it, but we rely on our database to support some
new features to fix this issue.

### Filtering

Most endpoints support a `filters` query parameter to drill down into your data. Currently, only simple equality filters are supported.

An equality filter can be specified with url-encoded `==`. Filters can be joined together with `;` which applies a logical
`AND` operator to the filters. Here's a filter expression combining two filters:

```
visit:browser==Firefox;visit:country==Estonia
```

## Examples of common queries

### Top pages

Let's say you want to show a similar report to the `Top pages` report in the Plausible UI. You can do this by calling the
`/api/v1/stats/breakdown` endpoint and specify `event:page` as the property to group by.

```bash title="Top pages"
curl https://plausible.io/api/v1/stats/breakdown?site_id=$SITE_ID&period=6mo&property=event:page&limit=5
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"
```

```json title="Response"
{
  "results": [
    {
      "page": "/",
      "visitors": 94298
    },
    {
      "page": "/blog/open-source-licenses",
      "visitors": 18803
    },
    {
      "page": "/plausible.io",
      "visitors": 20485
    },
    {
      "page": "/self-hosted-web-analytics",
      "visitors": 22236
    },
    {
      "page": "/sites",
      "visitors": 32386
    }
  ]
}
```

### Number of visitors to a specific page

Let's say you want to get the number of visitors to a specific page on your website like `/order/confirmation`. This can be achieved by
filtering your stats on the `event:page` property:

```bash title="Visitors to /order/confirmation"
curl https://plausible.io/api/v1/stats/aggregate?site_id=$SITE_ID&period=6mo&filters=event:page%3D%3D%2Forder%2Fconfirmation
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"
```

```json title="Response"
{
  "results": {
    "visitors": {
        "value": 1480
    }
  }
}
```

### Monthly traffic from Google

As a second example, let's imagine we want to analyze our SEO efforts for the last half year.
To graph your traffic from Google over time, you can use the `timeseries` endpoint with a time period `6mo` and
filter expression `visit:source==Google`.


```bash title="Monthly traffic from Google"
curl https://plausible.io/api/v1/stats/timeseries?site_id=$SITE_ID&period=6mo&filters=visit:browser%3D%3DChrome \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"
```

```json title="Response"
{
  "response": [
    {
        "date": "2020-09-01",
        "visitors": 2962
    },
    {
        "date": "2020-10-01",
        "visitors": 4974
    },
    {
        "date": "2020-11-01",
        "visitors": 5119
    },
    {
        "date": "2020-12-01",
        "visitors": 5397
    },
    {
        "date": "2021-01-01",
        "visitors": 7167
    },
    {
        "date": "2021-02-01",
        "visitors": 5802
    }
]
}
```

### Breakdown custom event by custom props

A more advanced use-case where custom events are used along with custom props. Let's say you have a `Download` custom event along with
a custom property called `method`. You can get a breakdown of download methods with the following query:

```bash title="Breakdown of download methods"
curl https://plausible.io/api/v1/stats/breakdown?site_id=$SITE_ID&period=6mo&property=event:props:method&filters=event:name%3D%3D%2Download
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"
```

```json title="Response"
{
    "results": [
        {
            "method": "HTTP",
            "visitors": 1477
        },
        {
            "method": "Magnet",
            "visitors": 370
        }
    ]
}
```
