Goals allow you to track actions that you want your visitors to take on your site. Actions such as signing up to a newsletter, clicking on a "**Download**" button, registering for a trial account, purchasing a product, clicking on an external link, downloading a file or completing a checkout form of an ecommerce store.

A goal can be a custom event or a pageview.

By setting up custom events or pageviews as goals, you can track the number of conversions, conversion rate, referrer sources and entry pages that are driving conversions and the top pages that people convert on. You can also follow the visitor journey using funnels.

After setting up a goal, it will show up in the "**Goal Conversions**" section of your dashboard as soon as we record the first conversion. Then you can click on the particular goal to filter your dashboard by it and get all the insights on the traffic that has converted on that specific goal.

There are several types of behavior analytics tools in Plausible Analytics:

| Goal                | Explanation                                                                                        |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Pageview goals](pageview-goals.md) | Measure how many people visit a specific page or section of your site. Use these to track the "thank you" page or the order confirmation page.
