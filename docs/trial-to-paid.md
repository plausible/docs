## Choose your tier and plan

Our subscription tiers are based on total pageviews and [custom events](/docs/custom-event-goals) across all the sites in your account. Check your current usage in the account settings and pick a tier that matches. You can get 2 free months with an annual subscription.

Next, choose a plan:

* **Starter** - Essential features for solo projects and new sites
* **Growth** - Team access and sharing tools for growing projects
* **Business** - Advanced marketing features, more sites and larger teams
* **Enterprise** - Custom plan with tailored limits. [Contact us](https://plausible.io/contact) to discuss or [learn more](https://plausible.io/enterprise-web-analytics)

Compare plans and pricing on [our website](https://plausible.io/#pricing). Then click "**Upgrade**" to continue.

If you skip this step, you can add these details later by opening any invoice from Paddle and clicking "**Add address & VAT Number**". More on managing invoices in [Download your invoices](/docs/download-invoices).
