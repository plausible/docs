In the "**Subscription**" section, your "**Monthly quota**" should list "**Free trial**". Click on "**Upgrade**" to upgrade your trial account to a paid subscription.

## Choose your subscription tier

Our subscription tiers are based on the total number of pageviews and custom events between all the sites you have added to your Plausible Analytics account.

You can check your usage levels during the trial period to date in your account settings within the "**Subscription**" section of your account settings. You should select a subscription tier that matches your usage levels. Opt for monthly or yearly billing. You can get 2 free months with an annual subscription.

* **Starter** - Essential features for solo projects and new sites  
* **Growth** - Team access and sharing tools for growing projects  
* **Business** - Advanced marketing features, more sites and larger teams  
* **Enterprise** - Custom plan with tailored limits. [Contact us](https://plausible.io/contact) to discuss

## Add your company address and VAT number

On the "**Payment**" screen in the upgrade process, you have the option to add your company address and VAT ID. Our payment processor Paddle handles all the VAT and other sales taxes, so if you're eligible no VAT will be charged on your subscription.

Your subscription will start right away. Your subscription will be renewed automatically, and you can change or cancel your plan at any time.

You will automatically get an email from Paddle with your invoice. You will get an automatic invoice sent to you through email for each payment that you make. You can also [download your invoices](download-invoices.md) in your Plausible account settings.

If you haven't added your company details and VAT number during the subscription process, you can open the invoice that Paddle sent you and click on the "**Add address & VAT Number**" link to do so.
