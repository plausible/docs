Our payment processor Paddle sends an invoice by email automatically after each payment. You can also download invoices directly from your Plausible account.

Log in and go to your account name → "**Account Settings**". In the "**Invoices**" section, you'll see a list of all invoices with a download link for each one.

## Add your company address and VAT number

Open any invoice from Paddle and click "**Add address & VAT Number**". Paddle handles VAT and sales taxes. If you provide a valid VAT ID, no VAT will be charged on future payments. [More on Paddle's VAT handling →](https://paddle.com/support/which-countries-does-paddle-charge-vat-for/)

## Change your billing address

Open any invoice and click "**Edit business address**" to update your address.

Changing the **country** on an existing subscription isn't possible due to tax regulations. To switch countries, wait for your current subscription to expire, cancel, then resubscribe from the same account with the new country. No data is lost in this process.

## Change the email address for invoices

Plausible and Paddle use separate email addresses. Your Plausible email is for logging in and viewing stats. Your Paddle email is where invoices are sent.

To change your invoice email, [contact us](https://plausible.io/contact) with your current Paddle email and the new address you'd like invoices sent to.
