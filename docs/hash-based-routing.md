title: Hashed page paths

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

If your site is using page paths with a `#` in the URL, you can use our "**Hashed page paths**" tracking to see the different pages your visitors have viewed.

You can enable "**Hashed page paths**" tracking as an optional measurement when adding a new site to your Plausible account. If the site has already been added to your account, you can control how data is collected in the "**Site Installation**" area of the "**General**" section in your [site settings](website-settings.md).

<img alt="Enable hashed page paths tracking during onboarding" src={useBaseUrl('img/onboarding-enable-hash-based-tracking.png')} />

After you change the tracking snippet on your site, all the hash-based page paths will start being tracked and will be displayed in the "**Top Pages**" report of your Plausible Analytics dashboard.
