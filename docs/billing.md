## Is the billing based per account or per website?

Billing is based on total usage across all the sites in your account. Check your usage numbers at any time in the "**Subscription**" section of your account settings. For details on how usage is calculated, see [Choose the right subscription](subscription-plans.md).

## How do I get an invoice?

Paddle (our payment processor) emails you an invoice automatically after each payment. You can also download invoices in your account settings. See [Download your invoices](download-invoices.md).

The invoice email goes to your Paddle email address, which may differ from your Plausible login email. To change it, [contact us](https://plausible.io/contact) with your current and desired invoice email.

## What payment methods do you accept?

Credit/debit card, PayPal, Apple Pay and Google Pay. All payment processing is handled by Paddle. We're not able to accept wire transfers, manual invoicing or cryptocurrency.

If paying via PayPal, make sure a valid card is linked to your PayPal account. Paddle requires this for recurring subscriptions.

## How do I add my VAT number?

During checkout, you can add your company address and VAT ID. Paddle handles all sales taxes. If you're eligible, no VAT will be charged.

If you didn't add it during checkout, open any Paddle invoice and click "**Add address & VAT Number**". [More on Paddle's VAT handling →](https://paddle.com/support/which-countries-does-paddle-charge-vat-for/)

## How do I change my VAT number?

Paddle does not allow editing the VAT number on an existing subscription. To update it, let your current subscription run until the end of the billing period, cancel it and resubscribe from the same Plausible account with the correct VAT details. All your Plausible data, sites and settings stay unchanged during this process.

## How do I change my billing address?

Open any invoice and click "**Edit business address**" to update your street address, city or postal code.

## How do I change the country on my subscription?

Paddle does not allow changing the country on an existing subscription due to tax regulations. To switch countries, let your current subscription run until the end of the billing period, cancel it and resubscribe from the same Plausible account with the new country. All your Plausible data, sites and settings stay unchanged during this process.

## What happens if I exceed my pageview limit?

No surprise fees. An occasional traffic spike won't trigger extra charges or stop your stats from being counted. A single month over your limit requires no action. If traffic drops back within your tier the following month, nothing happens.

If usage exceeds your tier for **two consecutive months**, we'll notify you to upgrade. The change is pro-rated so you only pay the difference. If you don't upgrade within a week, your dashboards are temporarily locked. Even while locked, stats continue to be collected in the background and you still have access to your site settings and account settings. Dashboards are automatically unlocked at the start of the next billing cycle if your usage drops back within limits. You can also unlock them at any time by upgrading to the appropriate tier.

If the spike is temporary, you can upgrade to restore access and downgrade again when traffic drops. Downgrades are pro-rated too, so you won't lose out. You're never locked into a higher plan when your usage no longer requires it. This works the same way on both monthly and yearly billing.

We're not able to make exceptions to keep dashboards unlocked beyond the grace period. See [Choose the right subscription](subscription-plans.md#traffic-spikes-and-overages) for the full details.

## How does pro-rating work when I upgrade?

Paddle calculates a pro-rated charge based on what you've already paid and the time remaining on your current billing cycle. You only pay the difference.

## How does it work when I downgrade?

If you downgrade to a lower tier, you'll see a negative immediate payment amount. This is a credit balance that automatically reduces your future payments until it's used up.

## How do I update my payment method?

In your account settings, go to the "**Subscription**" section. Under "**Next bill amount**", click "**Update billing info**".
