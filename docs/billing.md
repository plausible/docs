## Is the billing based per account or per website?

Billing is based on total usage across all the sites in your account. Check your usage numbers at any time in the "**Subscription**" section of your account settings. For details on how usage is calculated, see [Choose the right subscription](/docs/subscription-plans).

## How do I get an invoice?

Paddle (our payment processor) emails you an invoice automatically after each payment. You can also download invoices in your account settings. See [Download your invoices](/docs/download-invoices).

The invoice email goes to your Paddle email address, which may differ from your Plausible login email. To change it, [contact us](https://plausible.io/contact) with your current and desired invoice email.

## What payment methods do you accept?

Credit/debit card, PayPal, Apple Pay and Google Pay. All payment processing is handled by Paddle. We're not able to accept wire transfers, manual invoicing or cryptocurrency.

If paying via PayPal, make sure a valid card is linked to your PayPal account. Paddle requires this for recurring subscriptions.

## How do I add my VAT number?

During checkout, you can add your company address and VAT ID. Paddle handles all sales taxes. If you're eligible, no VAT will be charged.

If you didn't add it during checkout, open any Paddle invoice and click "**Add address & VAT Number**". [More on Paddle's VAT handling →](https://paddle.com/support/which-countries-does-paddle-charge-vat-for/)

## How do I change my billing address?

Open any invoice and click "**Edit business address**".

Changing the **country** on an existing subscription isn't possible due to tax regulations. To switch countries, wait for your current billing period to end, cancel, then resubscribe from the same account with the new country. No data is lost.

## What happens if I exceed my pageview limit?

No surprise fees. An occasional traffic spike won't trigger extra charges or stop your stats from being counted.

If usage exceeds your tier for two consecutive months, we'll email you to upgrade. Changes are pro-rated. If you don't upgrade within a week, stats are temporarily locked until you move to the right tier or usage drops back within limits. See [Choose the right subscription](/docs/subscription-plans#traffic-spikes-and-overages) for the full details.

## How does pro-rating work when I upgrade?

Paddle calculates a pro-rated charge based on what you've already paid and the time remaining on your current billing cycle. You only pay the difference.

## How does it work when I downgrade?

If you downgrade to a lower tier, you'll see a negative immediate payment amount. This is a credit balance that automatically reduces your future payments until it's used up.

## How do I update my payment method?

In your account settings, go to the "**Subscription**" section. Under "**Next bill amount**", click "**Update billing info**".
