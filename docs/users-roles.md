Plausible allows you to create a team for your organization, invite team members to view stats and change your site settings, and to manage your Plausible subscription and invoices as well. You can also invite external collaborators as guests and give them access to specific sites only. 

## Working with your team

### Creating a new team

Log in to your Plausible Analytics account and in the top right menu, click on your account name and choose "**Create a Team**". Note that you may not see this option if you're already a member of an existing team or if you haven't added any sites to your account.

* Give the name to your team.
* Invite individual team members. You can invite any email address. It doesn't necessarily need to be an email address from your company. You can invite existing Plausible users or people who don't have a Plausible account. You can also turn any existing guest into a team member. 
* Assign individual team members their roles

They will need to register for a Plausible account with the email address that was invited (or log in to their existing Plausible account registered with that email address) and accept your invitation. All invitations expire after 48 hours

### Managing team member roles

When managing team members, you can choose between five different roles:

1. "**Owner**" gets access to everything and can manage the team, sites and subscription itself. An owner can also delete a team 
2. "**Admin**" can manage sites and team members
3. "**Editor**" gets access to all your stats dashboards and can change the site settings
4. "**Billing**" can manage your Plausible subscription, payments and invoices 
5. "**Viewer**" can view the stats dashboards of the sites that the team owns 

You can change the role of a team member at any time:

* In the top right menu, click on your account name, make sure you have chosen the team you'd like to manage and then click on the "**Team Settings**"
* You can adjust roles of existing members within the "**General**" option of the "**Team Settings**"
* Click on the current role next to the name of the person you'd like to change the role for
* Choose a new role for the user

That's it. The team member now has a different role.

## Working with external collaborators

You can also invite external collaborators as guests and give them access to specific sites only. This is useful when working with consultants, freelancers and other individuals who don't need access to all the sites. Here's how to invite guests.

### Inviting external collaborators as guests to individual sites

:::tip Want to share a single dashboard with someone without them needing a Plausible account?
Our [private and secure shared links](shared-links.md) are a great way to share a particular dashboard quickly 
:::

* Go into [the site settings](website-settings.md) of the website you'd like to invite guests to
* Click on the "**People**" section on the left-hand sidebar
* Click on the "**Invite New Guest**" button
* Enter the email address of the person you'd like to invite. If you invite a new person to Plausible, they will need to register for a Plausible account with the exact email address that you invited
* Assign the role for the invited user. You can choose between two different roles:

1. "**Guest Admin**" gets access to the stats dashboard, can change the site settings and invite other guests
2. "**Guest Viewer**" gets access to the stats dashboard

* Click on the "**Invite**" button. We will email the invited person to notify them about your invitation. They will need to register for a Plausible account with the email address that was invited (or log in to their existing Plausible account registered with that email address) and accept your invitation. All invitations expire after 48 hours
