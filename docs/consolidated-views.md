If you have multiple websites/dashboards in your Plausible account, the consolidated view gives you an overview of traffic across all your websites. This allows you to quickly see the total number of visitors and other key metrics across all your properties in one place.

It looks just like any other Plausible dashboard, but the data includes all your sites instead of just one. 

## How to enable your consolidated view?

To have a consolidated view, you need:

1) To have a [team](/users-roles#creating-a-new-team) set up
2) At least two sites in that team
3) A Plausible Business plan (or a custom plan with Business features)

Once your team meets these requirements, your consolidated view will appear automatically on the /sites page (where all your dashboards are listed). You will be able to open the consolidated view dashboard from here.

## Configuration

Just like a regular site, a consolidated view has its own settings. You can access the settings directly from the /sites page, or the site picker menu on the top left of the consolidated dashboard.

#### Timezone

You can change the timezone used for your consolidated stats. By default, it uses the timezone set for the majority of your sites.

#### Goals

To see conversions on your consolidated dashboard, add your [goals](https://plausible.io/docs/goal-conversions) manually, just like you would on a regular site.

#### Custom properties

Just like goals, [custom properties](https://plausible.io/docs/custom-props/introduction) need to be added manually too. 

#### Email reports

You can enable [email reports](https://plausible.io/docs/email-reports) that combine traffic from all your sites.

## Limitations

#### Imported data

Currently, consolidated views do not include any imported data.

#### Revenue goals

Revenue goals are currently not supported in consolidated views.
