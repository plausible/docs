import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

Within the "**Danger zone**" section of your website settings you can delete your site from Plausible Analytics. This also removes all the stats you've collected until that point. Click on the big red "**Delete**" button to delete your site and your stats from Plausible Analytics.
