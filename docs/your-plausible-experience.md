To use Plausible Analytics, you need to [register an account](https://plausible.io/register) and add [our tracking snippet](plausible-script.md) to your site. 

To explore the product, we offer you a free 30-day trial. There are no restrictions on your usage during the free trial and no credit card is required to sign up.

Here are the steps you can take to get the most out of your Plausible experience:

## Enable email/Slack reports and notifications for traffic spikes

You can decide to enable weekly (every Monday) and/or monthly (every 1st day of the month) reports to be sent directly via email. [See instructions here](email-reports.md).

You can also enable traffic spike notifications to be sent directly via email. This will help notify you when your site has an unusually high number of current visitors. [See instructions here](traffic-spikes.md).

And you can get the same reports and traffic spike notifications in Slack too. [See instructions here](slack-reports.md).

## Integrate with Search Console to get keyword phrases people find your site with

You can enable the Google Search Console integration to get all the search keywords people find your site with in Google's search results directly in your Plausible dashboard. [See instructions here](google-search-console-integration.md).

## Set up some easy goals including 404 error pages and outbound link clicks

Plausible allows you to track custom event goals like button clicks, form completions and anything else you can think of. [See the instructions here](custom-event-goals.md). 

You can also enable some easy-to-use goals. Here are instructions on how to track [404 error pages](404-error-pages-tracking.md) and how to track [outbound link clicks](outbound-link-click-tracking.md) in your Plausible dashboard.

## Start using UTM tags in your marketing campaigns

To minimize the amount of traffic that falls within the "direct / none" referral source, you can add special query parameters to your links in social media, email newsletters and your advertising campaigns. 

`ref`, `source`, `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_content` and `utm_term` query parameters are all valid and supported by Plausible Analytics. [Learn more here](manual-link-tagging.md).

## Share your stats with a private link or open them up to the public

You can share your Plausible stats with (potential) partners or advertisers. Or if you're working for an agency or working as a freelancer, you can share the site stats with your clients by generating a shared private link. The shared link is secure and impossible to guess by default. You can even password protect it. [Learn more here](shared-links.md).

You can also choose to be transparent and make your site stats public so anyone with your stats dashboard link can view them. [Learn here how](visibility.md).

## Invite team members and other collaborators

Plausible makes it easy to invite team members, clients and other collaborators. You can invite team members and also assign their roles. You can choose to give people access to the stats dashboard only or give them the permission to edit site settings and invite other collaborators.  

You can learn more about [user accounts and levels](users-roles.md).

## Opt out from counting your own visits

When you're working on your site, you might not want to record your own visits and page views. Here's [how to opt out and exclude yourself from your analytics](excluding.md).

## You can proxy our script

If you'd like to serve the script as a first-party connection from your domain name, we offer a way to proxy our script. See [full details here](/proxy/introduction.md).

Now you're ready to start exploring your [fast loading, ethical and actionable Plausible Analytics dashboard](https://plausible.io/sites).
