title: Cancel your subscription plan
---

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

Log in to your Plausible account. In the top right menu, click your account name → "**Account Settings**".

Go to the "**Subscription**" section and click "**Cancel my subscription**".

<img alt="Cancel your Plausible subscription" src={useBaseUrl('img/account-settings-cancel-subscription.png')} />

After canceling:

* Your stats **keep being counted** and you have full access until the end of your current billing period.
* Once the billing period ends, your stats dashboard will be locked but your data is **not deleted**. If you resubscribe later, everything will still be there.
* If you change your mind before the period ends, you can resubscribe from the same "**Subscription**" section.

Want to switch to a different plan instead of canceling? See [Change your subscription plan](change-plan.md).
