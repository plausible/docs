title: Change your reporting time format
---

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

Within the "**General**" section of your website settings you can change the time format for your reports in the "**Time Format**" field. This sets the time format of your dashboards to either `AM/PM` or `24H`. 

For instance, if you select "**24h**" then the hours after midday will be shown from `13h` (one o'clock) to `24h` (midnight) instead of `1pm` and `0am`, respectively.
