title: Proxying Plausible through Netlify
---

We've removed old proxying instructions due to being out of date. [See our general proxying guide](/proxy/introduction).

:::tip Don't want to manage your own proxy? We can handle it for you
Our managed proxy lets you send analytics through your own domain name as a first-party connection. All you need to do is set up a CNAME record using the instructions we'll send you and update the snippet on your site. We'll take care of everything else. [Contact us for details](https://plausible.io/contact).
