Installing Plausible on a website can be a slightly different process depending on what tools you're using to manage your site.

We've put together several guides that cover popular website builders and content management systems (CMS). These can help you set up and start counting your site visitors in no time. Thanks to the members of our community, there are also third-party integrations and plugins for various frameworks.

## Official integrations

These are built and maintained by the Plausible team.

### Add the snippet to the header of your site

To integrate your website with Plausible, you can manually insert our tracking snippet into the header section of your site. See [the details here](plausible-script.md).

### WordPress plugin

Using WordPress? We have an official WordPress plugin that makes the integration nice and easy. [Here's how to get started with our WordPress plugin](https://plausible.io/wordpress-analytics-plugin).

### Google Tag Manager (GTM)

Using GTM? You can use our Google Tag Manager template. See how to integrate Plausible into your site with [Google Tag Manager](https://plausible.io/gtm-template).

### NPM package

[NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@plausible-analytics/tracker): A lightweight library to add Plausible tracking to your site through an easy-to-install NPM package.

### Run Plausible as a first-party connection

You can run Plausible script as a first-party connection from your domain name in order to bypass adblockers. [Learn more here](proxy/introduction.md).

### Server side tracking and mobile apps tracking

Our events API can be used to record pageviews and custom events server side without the use of JavaScript. You can use the events API to count users on your Android and/or iOS mobile apps too. [Learn more here](events-api.md)
