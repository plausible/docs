title: Integration guides
---

Installing Plausible on a site can be a slightly different process depending on what tools you're using. 

We've put together several guides that cover popular website builders and content management systems (CMS). These can help you set up and start counting your site visitors in no time.

Thanks to the members of our community, there are also integrations and plugins for various frameworks. 

Here's the full list in alphabetical order:

## DNT and offline functionality

You can use Plausible with [the analytics library](https://github.com/ian/analytics/tree/main/packages/plausible).

Built and maintained by [David Wells](https://github.com/DavidWells).

:::note
Plausible by default doesn't take DNT (Do Not Track) into consideration as we're a privacy first analytics tool and [DNT allows](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track) "data analysis techniques that protect the anonymity of the users".
