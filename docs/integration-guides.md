title: Integration guides
---

Installing Plausible on a site can be a slightly different process depending on what tools you're using. We've put together several guides that cover popular website builders and content management systems (CMS). These can help you set up and start counting your site visitors in no time.

Thanks to the members of our community, there are also integrations and plugins for various frameworks. Let us know about any other integrations that you've built and we will feature them. Thanks for your support!

Here's how to get Plausible Analytics up and running on your site.

## WordPress

We have a WordPress plugin that makes the integration with WordPress nice and easy.

## Google Tag Manager (GTM)

Plausible can even be integrated using the Google Tag Manager. Add the Plausible snippet to the "**Custom HTML Tag**" and set the trigger to be "**All Pages**" if you want to count traffic on all of your pages.

Note that you cannot use Google Tag Manager if you want to track a subfolder. Only naked domain (yoursite.com) or subdomain (subdomain.yoursite.com) will work as the data-domain attribute while a subfolder (yoursite.com/subfolder) will not.

## Plugin that adds DNT and offline functionality 

You can now use Plausible with [the analytics library](https://github.com/ian/analytics/tree/main/packages/plausible).

Built and maintained by [David Wells](https://github.com/DavidWells).
 
:::note
Plausible by default doesn't take DNT (Do Not Track) into consideration as we're a privacy first analytics tool and [DNT allows](https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track) "data analysis techniques that protect the anonymity of the users".
:::

## Paste the script into the header section

Alternatively, you can [integrate Plausible into your site manually](plausible-script.md) by pasting the Plausible Analytics tracking script code into the Header (`<head>`) section of your site.
