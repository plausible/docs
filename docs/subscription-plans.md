Plausible gives you control and flexibility in plans you can subscribe to, the billing frequency and in upgrading or downgrading your subscription tier based on your usage. Here's how to choose the subscription that's right for you.

## How are the subscriptions priced?

Our subscription tiers are based on the total number of pageviews and custom events between all the sites you have added to your Plausible Analytics account.

To calculate your usage levels, we take all the websites you have added to your account and total the number of pageviews between them. If you use the "[Custom Events](custom-event-goals.md)" feature, then these count towards your total usage as well.

"**Custom Events**" include external link clicks, file downloads and 404 error page tracking. The act of adding a "[Pageview Goal](pageview-goals.md)" has no effect on your usage.

You can check your usage levels in your account settings within the "**Subscription**" section. You should be on a subscription tier that fits your usage levels. You can get 2 months free on a yearly plan.

Next, choose your plan. Each plan offers different features, site limits and team access:

* **Starter** - Essential features for solo projects and new sites  
* **Growth** - Team access and sharing tools for growing projects  
* **Business** - Advanced marketing features, more sites and larger teams  
* **Enterprise** - Custom plan with tailored limits. [Contact us](https://plausible.io/contact) to discuss

You can see [the pricing and the differences between the plans](https://plausible.io/#pricing) on our website or within your Plausible account settings.

## What happens if I go over my monthly page views limit?

You will never be charged extra for an occasional traffic spike. We will never stop counting your stats because of an occasional traffic spike. There are no surprise fees and your card will never be charged unexpectedly. 

Suppose new higher traffic levels become your new standard and your page views exceed your subscription plan for two consecutive months. In that case, we will contact you and ask you to upgrade your subscription plan to accommodate your new traffic levels using our self-serve platform. The new charge will be prorated to reflect the amount you have already paid and the time until your current subscription is supposed to expire. 

To maintain access to your stats, you will need to upgrade your account to accommodate your new traffic levels. If you do not upgrade your account within a week, our automated system will lock the stats making them inaccessible. Your stats will be automatically unlocked once you upgrade to the appropriate tier or if your usage falls back within your subscription limits.

## How do I manage my subscription?

Everything is self-serve within your account settings. There are no long term contracts and you can change your subscription or cancel your plan at any time. Here's how to [change your subscription plan](change-plan.md) and how to [cancel your subscription](cancel-subscription.md).
