Plausible gives you full control over your subscription. Choose a plan, pick monthly or yearly billing and upgrade or downgrade as your needs change. No long-term contracts.

## How usage is calculated

Your subscription tier is based on the total number of **pageviews** and **[custom events](custom-event-goals.md)** across all the sites in your account.

Custom events include outbound link clicks, file downloads, 404 error tracking and any manually tracked events. Adding a [pageview goal](pageview-goals.md) does not count towards your usage.

Check your current usage in the "**Subscription**" section of your account settings and pick a tier that matches.

## Plans

Each plan offers different features, site limits and team member access:

* **Starter** - Essential features for solo projects and new sites
* **Growth** - Team access and sharing tools for growing projects
* **Business** - Advanced marketing features, more sites and larger teams
* **Enterprise** - Custom plan with tailored limits. [Contact us](https://plausible.io/contact) to discuss

Compare features and pricing on [our website](https://plausible.io/#pricing) or in your account settings. Save 2 months by choosing yearly billing.

## Traffic spikes and overages

You will never be charged extra for an occasional traffic spike. No surprise fees, no stats interruption, no unexpected charges.

If higher traffic becomes your new normal and pageviews exceed your tier for **two consecutive months**, we'll email you and ask you to upgrade. The new charge is pro-rated. You only pay the difference for the remaining time on your current billing cycle.

If you don't upgrade within a week of our notice, stats will be temporarily locked until you move to the right tier or your usage drops back within your limits.

## Managing your subscription

Everything is self-serve in your account settings:

* **[Change your plan](change-plan.md)** - switch tiers, change billing frequency or move between plans. All changes are pro-rated.
* **[Cancel your subscription](cancel-subscription.md)** - you keep access to your stats until the end of the current billing period.
* **[Download invoices](download-invoices.md)** - get invoices, add VAT numbers and change billing address.
