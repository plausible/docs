Plausible gives you full control over your subscription. Choose a plan, pick monthly or yearly billing and upgrade or downgrade as your needs change. No long-term contracts.

## How usage is calculated

Your subscription tier is based on the total number of **pageviews** and **[custom events](custom-event-goals.md)** across all the sites in your account.

Custom events include outbound link clicks, file downloads, 404 error tracking and any manually tracked events. Adding a [pageview goal](pageview-goals.md) does not count towards your usage.

Check your current usage in the "**Subscription**" section of your account settings and pick a tier that matches.

## Plans

Each plan offers different features, site limits and team member access:

* **Starter** - Essential features for solo projects and new sites
* **Growth** - Team access and sharing tools for growing projects
* **Business** - Advanced marketing features, more sites and larger teams
* **Enterprise** - Custom plan with tailored limits. [Contact us](https://plausible.io/contact) to discuss

Compare features and pricing on [our website](https://plausible.io/#pricing) or in your account settings. Save 2 months by choosing yearly billing.

## Traffic spikes and overages

You will never be charged extra for an occasional traffic spike. No surprise fees, no stats interruption, no unexpected charges.

A single month over your limit requires no action. If your traffic drops back within your tier the following month, nothing happens and no upgrade is needed. This is common with seasonal traffic, viral posts or one-off campaigns.

If pageviews exceed your tier for **two consecutive months**, we'll notify you and ask you to upgrade to a tier that fits your new traffic levels. The upgrade is pro-rated so you only pay the difference for the remaining time on your current billing cycle.

If you don't upgrade within a week of our notice, your dashboards will be temporarily locked. Even while locked, your stats continue to be collected in the background and you still have full access to your site settings and account settings. Dashboards are automatically unlocked at the start of the next billing cycle if your usage drops back within your subscription limits. You can also unlock them at any time by upgrading to the appropriate tier.

If the higher traffic turns out to be temporary, you can upgrade to restore access and then downgrade again once your traffic drops. Downgrades are pro-rated too, so you won't lose out. You're never locked into a higher plan when your usage no longer requires it. This works the same way on both monthly and yearly billing.

We're not able to make exceptions to keep dashboards unlocked beyond the grace period, so if you're consistently above your tier, upgrading is the quickest way to restore access.

## Managing your subscription

Everything is self-serve in your account settings:

* **[Change your plan](change-plan.md)** - switch tiers, change billing frequency or move between plans. All changes are pro-rated.
* **[Cancel your subscription](cancel-subscription.md)** - you keep access to your stats until the end of the current billing period.
* **[Download invoices](download-invoices.md)** - get invoices, add VAT numbers and change billing address.
