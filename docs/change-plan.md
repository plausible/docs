import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

Log in to your Plausible account. In the top right menu, click your account name → "**Account Settings**".

Go to the "**Subscription**" section and click "**Change plan**".

<img alt="Change Plausible Plan" src={useBaseUrl('img/account-settings-change-plan.png')} />

Select your new plan, tier and billing frequency (monthly or yearly), then click "**Preview changes**".

<img alt="Preview plan changes" src={useBaseUrl('img/preview-plan-changes.png')} />

You'll see a summary of the change:

* **Immediate charge** - a pro-rated amount reflecting what you've already paid and the time remaining on your current cycle. A negative amount means you have a credit balance that will automatically reduce your upcoming payments until it's used up.
* **Next renewal** - the date and amount of your next regular payment.

Click "**Confirm plan change**" to apply.

Your subscription renews automatically and you can change or [cancel](cancel-subscription.md) at any time.
