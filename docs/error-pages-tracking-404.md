Tracking 404 error pages is essential for many site owners and Plausible helps you automate this process. With our "**404 error pages**" tracking you can:

* Get an easy overview of which 404 pages are accessed by your visitors (you can even group error pages by any keyword)
* See where visitors find broken links to your 404 error pages
* Then you can manually fix broken links and redirect error pages

"**404 error pages**" is an [optional enhanced measurement](script-extensions.md). If you want to track 404 error pages, here's how to enable it:

## Step 1: Enable "404 error pages" for your site

You can enable "**404 error pages**" as an optional measurement when adding a new site to your Plausible account. If the site has already been added to your account, you can control what data is collected in the "**Site Installation**" area of the "**General**" section in your [site settings](website-settings.md).

## Step 2: Change the snippet on your site

The tracking snippet changes depending on your selection of optional measurements. When making changes to your optional measurements, do ensure to insert the newest snippet into your site for all tracking to work as expected.

Your Plausible tracking snippet should be inserted into [the Header (`<head>`) section of your site](plausible-script.md). Place the tracking script within the `<head> â€¦ </head>` tags.

## Step 3: Paste this piece of code to your 404 page template

Add this code to your 404 page. For instance, if you're using WordPress, your 404 page template will be called `404.php`. It will be located within your theme files.

```html
<script>document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () { plausible('404'); });</script>
```

You can place this code anywhere in the `<head>` or `<body>` section of your 404 page template.

You'll see the "**404**" goal as soon as the first visit on a 404 error page has been tracked.
