Tracking 404 error pages is essential for many site owners and Plausible helps you automate this process. With our "**404 error pages**" tracking you can:

* Get an easy overview of which 404 pages are accessed by your visitors (you can even group error pages by any keyword)
* See where visitors find broken links to your 404 error pages
* Then you can manually fix broken links and redirect error pages

"**404 error pages**" is an [optional enhanced measurement](script-extensions.md). If you want to track 404 error pages, here's how to enable it:

## Paste this piece of code to your 404 page template

Add this code to your 404 page. For instance, if you're using WordPress, your 404 page template will be called `404.php`. It will be located within your theme files.

```html
<script>document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () { plausible('404'); });</script>
```

You can place this code anywhere in the `<head>` or `<body>` section of your 404 page template.

## See all the visits on 404 error pages in your dashboard

After you change the tracking snippet on your site and after you tag your 404 page template, all the visits on 404 error pages will start being tracked and will be displayed in the "**Goal Conversions**" report of your Plausible Analytics dashboard. You'll see the "**404**" goal as soon as the first visit on a 404 error page has been tracked.

Click on "**404**" to see the full list of all visits on all error pages and have your dashboard filtered by error pages only. Click on a particular error page URL to filter the dashboard by those clicks only and get the full overview of that specific URL. Then you can figure out how your visitors discover the broken links and fix them.

You can also group 404 error pages by any keyword. In the "**Filter**" button in the top right of your dashboard, choose "**Property**". Then select "**path**" (this includes all the 404 error page paths we have recorded) and use the "**contains**" option. Add whatever keyword you want to group 404 error pages by and click on the "**Apply Filter**" button.
