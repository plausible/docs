title: Enable optional measurements
---

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

The Plausible script offers enhanced measurements and configuration options to tailor tracking to your needs.

You can enable optional measurements for form submissions, outbound link clicks and file downloads when adding a new site to your Plausible account, or later in the "**Site installation**" area under "**General**" in your [site settings](website-settings.md).

There are also additional measurement options that you can set up manually if needed.

Here's the list of our optional measurements:

### Manual pageviews

By default, the Plausible script triggers a pageview when it's first loaded. It also attaches listeners to the History API and will automatically trigger pageviews when you use `history.pushState`. This is useful for most websites but we also allow disabling `autoCapturePageviews` in case you want full control over when pageviews are triggered on your website.

One of the use-cases for this is when you use [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/) (formerly [Turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks)). In that case, you want to manually trigger Plausible pageviews on the `turbo:load` or `turbolinks:load` browser event depending which library you use.

To do so, add update `plausible.init` to disable `autoCapturePageviews`: `plausible.init({ autoCapturePageviews: false })`

Additionally, add a javascript listener that triggers pageviews on turbolinks navigation:

```javascript
document.addEventListener("turbo:load", function() {
  plausible('pageview')
})
```

:::note
Every script call with `'pageview'` results in a separate pageview being counted even if called on the same page

#### Specify custom locations for your page URLs

Triggering pageviews manually allows you to provide a special option named `url` with your events. This allows you to specify the URL of the page and can be used to specify custom locations.

It's especially helpful to redact and aggregate multiple pages whose URLs contain identifiers that are specific to users. [Learn more about specifying custom URLs in your events](custom-locations.md).

#### Track custom query parameters for complete page URLs

By default, Plausible strips all query parameters for privacy purposes [except for](top-referrers.md) `ref`, `source`, `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_content` and `utm_term`.

This means that pages like `yoursite.com/blog/index.php?article=some_article&page=11` will be reported as `yoursite.com/blog/index.php` in the "**Top Pages**" report of your Plausible dashboard.

By using the manual script extension, you can also track custom query parameters and get the complete page URLs in your "**Top Pages**" report. Learn here [how to do that](custom-query-params.md).
