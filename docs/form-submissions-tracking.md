If you use the form submissions tracking feature, then these count towards your billable monthly pageviews.

Plausible helps you automate tracking form submissions. With our "**Form submissions**" tracking you can:

## Enable "Form submissions" for your site

You can enable "**Form submissions**" as an optional measurement when adding a new site to your Plausible account. If the site has already been added to your account, you can control what data is collected in the "**Site Installation**" area of the "**General**" section in your [site settings](website-settings.md).

<!-- TODO -->
<img alt="Enable form submissions tracking during onboarding" src={useBaseUrl('img/onboarding-enable-outbound-link-clicks-tracking.png')} />

After you enable form submissions click tracking, we will automatically add a new goal called `Form: Submission` to your site.

:::tip Using WordPress?
The quickest way to start tracking form submissions is to use our [official WordPress plugin](https://plausible.io/wordpress-analytics-plugin)

## See all the form submissions clicks in your dashboard

Click on "**Form: Submission**" goal in the "**Goal Conversions**" report of your Plausible dashboard to see the full list of all form submissions and have your dashboard filtered by them. You can see:

* The number of total form submissions
* The number of unique form submissions
* The conversion rate
* Top referral sources that lead to submissions
* Top pages that drive the submissions
* Countries that submit forms
* Devices (screen size, browser, OS) that click on forms

Click on a particular form URL to filter the dashboard by those submissions only and get the full overview of that specific URL.
